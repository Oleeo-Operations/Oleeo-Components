Y8 Geography is taught on a carousel basis with other Humanities subjects, led by subject specialists and in Y9 move into Humanities sets with 3 lessons a fortnight. GCSE Geography uptake is traditionally very strong with six classes currently across Years 10 and 11, due not least of all to the excellent results and progress that students of the department have consistently achieved in recent years. The department is well-resourced, the main classrooms being equipped with an interactive whiteboard and variety of physical materials to support teaching to a high standard. In addition, the department is increasingly integrating technology into its teaching both inside and outside of the classroom. The department continue to develop a range of enrichment for students and are always keen to seek out new opportunities.</p><p>The post would suit an ambitious, energetic and rigorous teacher, keen to bring their own brand of imagination and excellence to the Geography department in order to continue its strong record of achievement.
